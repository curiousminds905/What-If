      <h3>What if the Sun disappeared?</h3>
      <p>Earth would freeze within weeks, oceans would solidify, and life would collapse rapidly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="images/blackhole.jpeg" alt="Blackhole">
      <h3>What if humans could travel through a black hole?</h3>
      <p>It could allow shortcuts through spacetime, but extreme gravity might destroy all matter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <img src="images/whiteholes.jpg" alt="Whitehole">
      <h3>What if white holes are exits of black holes?</h3>
      <p>Matter could emerge elsewhere in the universe, challenging our understanding of causality.</p>

      <img src="images/sandclock.jpeg" alt="Time">
      <h3>What if time stopped in space?</h3>
      <p>Motion, reactions, and even light would freeze, making the universe static.</p>

    <!-- WITHOUT IMAGES -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if Earth had two moons?</h3>
      <p>Tides, climate, and night skies would change dramatically.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if gravity suddenly vanished?</h3>
      <p>Planets would drift away and stars would lose their structure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if the speed of light were slower?</h3>
      <p>Communication and perception of reality would completely change.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if Earth was closer to the Sun?</h3>
      <p>Temperatures would rise, oceans could evaporate, and life might not exist.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if Earth was farther from the Sun?</h3>
      <p>The planet could become an ice world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if stars never died?</h3>
      <p>The universe would lack heavy elements needed for life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if galaxies collided?</h3>
      <p>Stars would rarely crash, but gravitational chaos would reshape space.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if dark matter didn’t exist?</h3>
      <p>Galaxies might never have formed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if humans lived on Mars?</h3>
      <p>We would need artificial ecosystems and protection from radiation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if asteroids stopped hitting Earth?</h3>
      <p>Life’s evolutionary path might have been completely different.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if Earth had rings like Saturn?</h3>
      <p>Climate patterns and night skies would be spectacular.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if the universe stopped expanding?</h3>
      <p>It could collapse back into a Big Crunch.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if aliens are observing us?</h3>
      <p>They might avoid contact to study natural evolution.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if wormholes were stable?</h3>
      <p>Instant interstellar travel could become possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if stars could think?</h3>
      <p>Conscious cosmic entities would redefine intelligence.</p>
