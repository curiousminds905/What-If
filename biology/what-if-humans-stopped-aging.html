    <h1>What If Humans Stopped Aging?</h1>

    <section>
        <p>
            Aging is a natural biological process that affects every living organism. From the moment we are born, 
            our cells begin a gradual journey of growth, repair, and eventual decline. Wrinkles form, muscles weaken, 
            and organs slowly lose efficiency. But what if this process suddenly stopped?
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine a world where humans reach adulthood and then remain biologically the same forever. 
            No physical decline. No age-related diseases. No natural expiration date. 
            Would it be a dream of immortality — or the beginning of unexpected challenges?
        </p>

        <h2>What We Know About Aging</h2>

        <p>
            Scientifically, aging is linked to several biological mechanisms. Cells accumulate damage over time. 
            Telomeres — protective caps at the ends of chromosomes — shorten with each cell division. 
            DNA mutations build up, and cells gradually lose their ability to repair themselves efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
            Researchers have identified processes like oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
            and reduced stem cell activity as major contributors to aging. 
            Some studies show caloric restriction and certain genetic modifications can extend lifespan in animals, 
            but completely stopping aging remains beyond current science.
        </p>

        <p>
            While medical advancements continue to increase life expectancy, 
            biological immortality has never been observed in humans.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What We Still Don’t Understand</h2>

        <p>
            Even with modern biology, major mysteries remain. 
            Can aging truly be separated from disease? 
            If aging stopped, would the brain still change over time? 
            Would memories accumulate infinitely without affecting mental stability?
        </p>

        <p>
            Scientists also question whether stopping aging would prevent cancer entirely, 
            or possibly increase mutation risks due to extended lifespan.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Immediate Biological Effects</h2>

        <p>
            If humans stopped aging at a certain age — for example, 25 — 
            physical appearance and strength would remain stable. 
            Age-related conditions like osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s disease, 
            and cardiovascular decline might drastically decrease.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, injuries, infections, and external causes of death would still exist. 
            Stopping aging does not mean becoming invincible.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Long-Term Effects on Society</h2>

        <p>
            The biggest transformation would likely occur socially and economically. 
            If people stopped aging and dying naturally, population growth could accelerate rapidly. 
            Resources such as food, water, housing, and energy would face extreme pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
            Retirement systems would collapse. 
            Career paths could stagnate if older generations never step aside. 
            Leadership positions might remain occupied indefinitely.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the other hand, humanity could benefit from centuries of accumulated experience. 
            Scientific breakthroughs might accelerate with longer research careers.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What Happens to Evolution?</h2>

        <p>
            Evolution depends on variation, reproduction, and selective pressures. 
            If humans no longer died from aging, natural selection would change dramatically.
        </p>

        <p>
            Genetic diversity might slow if older generations dominate reproduction patterns. 
            Mutation accumulation over centuries could create new biological challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aging may actually play an evolutionary role by allowing new generations 
            to adapt to changing environments.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Ethical Questions</h2>

        <p>
            If aging could be stopped, who would receive access? 
            Would it be available to everyone or only to the wealthy?
        </p>

        <p>
            Would birth rates need to be restricted? 
            Would death lose its meaning — or would life lose urgency?
        </p>

        <p>
            Mortality shapes culture, ambition, and progress. 
            Without it, humanity might gain time — but lose transformation.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            Aging is often seen as a flaw in biology, but it also drives renewal, growth, 
            and generational change. If humans stopped aging, we might achieve extended stability — 
            yet introduce deep biological and social complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
            The question is not only whether we can stop aging — 
            but whether we truly understand what it means to remove time from the human story.
