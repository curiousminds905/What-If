    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if gravity suddenly disappeared?</h3>
      <p>Everything would float away, planets would lose orbit, and the universe would collapse into chaos.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if time flowed backward?</h3>
      <p>Cause and effect would reverse, making reality impossible to understand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if the speed of light was infinite?</h3>
      <p>There would be no delay in seeing events, and relativity would not exist.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if the speed of light was slower?</h3>
      <p>Everyday life would involve visible delays in communication and motion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if friction did not exist?</h3>
      <p>Nothing could stop moving, and walking would be impossible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if energy was not conserved?</h3>
      <p>Physics laws would break, and perpetual motion machines could exist.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if mass could be negative?</h3>
      <p>Objects would accelerate in opposite directions to applied forces.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if electrons had no charge?</h3>
      <p>Atoms would not form, and matter as we know it would not exist.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if quantum effects were visible to humans?</h3>
      <p>Objects could exist in multiple places at the same time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if entropy decreased naturally?</h3>
      <p>Disorder would turn into order, violating the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if absolute zero was easily reachable?</h3>
      <p>All atomic motion would stop, changing material properties completely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if sound could travel in vacuum?</h3>
      <p>Space would no longer be silent, changing astronomy forever.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if inertia didn’t exist?</h3>
      <p>Objects would instantly stop when forces were removed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if magnetic monopoles existed?</h3>
      <p>Electric and magnetic theories would be rewritten.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if space was only two-dimensional?</h3>
      <p>Complex life and stable structures could not form.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if time moved at the same rate everywhere?</h3>
      <p>Relativity would not exist, simplifying the universe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if photons had mass?</h3>
      <p>Light would slow down and gravity would affect it differently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if forces suddenly changed strength?</h3>
      <p>Atoms could collapse or explode instantly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if parallel universes interact?</h3>
      <p>Energy and matter could leak between realities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>What if physical constants were variable?</h3>
      <p>The laws of nature would change with time and place.</p>
